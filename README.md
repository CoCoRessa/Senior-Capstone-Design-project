# Abstract
Bangladesh was once one of the Asian Least Developed Countries, but since the 2000s, it has been rapidly growing with an annual average economic growth rate of around 6-7%, based on its abundant and affordable labor force. However, despite this rapid economic growth, the standard of living in Bangladesh remains poor. To expect an overall improvement in the quality of life in Bangladesh, it's crucial that the country moves beyond mere rapid growth and strives for sustained economic development. Sustainable economic growth involves various economic entities, and among them, the growth of enterprises generally has a significant impact. Despite the importance of the role of enterprises, there is a lack of research and up-to-date insights into the current trends of Bangladesh enterprises. Therefore, this study aims to identify the current situation of Bangladesh companies and draw policy implications for corporate growth by analyzing the influencing factors of corporate labor productivity, an indicator that can measure corporate growth using Explainable Artificial Intelligence(XAI)
