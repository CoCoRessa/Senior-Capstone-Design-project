Senior Capstone Design Project

# Abstract
Bangladesh was once one of the Asian Least Developed Countries, but since the 2000s, it has been rapidly growing with an annual average economic growth rate of around 6-7%, based on its abundant and affordable labor force. However, despite this rapid economic growth, the standard of living in Bangladesh remains poor. To expect an overall improvement in the quality of life in Bangladesh, it's crucial that the country moves beyond mere rapid growth and strives for sustained economic development. Sustainable economic growth involves various economic entities, and among them, the growth of enterprises generally has a significant impact. Despite the importance of the role of enterprises, there is a lack of research and up-to-date insights into the current trends of Bangladesh enterprises. Therefore, this study aims to identify the current situation of Bangladesh companies and draw policy implications for corporate growth by analyzing the influencing factors of corporate labor productivity, an indicator that can measure corporate growth using Explainable Artificial Intelligence(XAI)

# Utilized Data
## To analyze the internal environment of an enterprise, Enterprise Survey are utilized
### The reasons for using the Bangladesh Enterprise Survey
> - Despite the lack of recent data in Bangladesh, it provides the most current data (2022) on the business environment
- The Enterprise Survey consists of over 300 specific survey items, allowing for a realistic assessment of the situation in Bangladesh
### Bangladesh Enterprise Survey Overview
- The survey conducted by WBES (World Bank Enterprise Surveys) targeted companies in the manufacturing and service sectors
- The purpose is to assess general company characteristics, infrastructure, sales and supply, competition, innovation, land and permits, finance, firm-government relations, exposure to bribery, labor, and performance
- Exists as sampling data not a complete review on every

## To analyze the external environment, such as the characteristics of the region where a enterprise is located, Boost Data and Economic Census are utilized
### Boost Data Overview
- Data depicting the status of budget and financial transactions in Bangladesh, categorized by executing departments, administrative regions, economic impacts, and thematic sectors
### Economic Census Overview
- A survey conducted nationwide targeting economic entities (establishments and households) to understand the industrial structure and distribution in Bangladesh

# Sampling Methodology
## The total sample size was determined based on Bangladesh's Gross National Income (GNI)
### Determine the total sample size based on the 2016 Bangladesh GNI
- In 2016, the GNI was $435 billion, resulting in a sample size of 1,000
- Using the Business Directory 2019 as a sampling frame, 1,000 samples were drawn from a list of 18,102 entries
- The Business Directory 2019 serves as the sampling frame produced by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics
### Based on stratified random sampling, it was divided into three strata
1. Industry: 7 categories: Garments, Textiles, Food, Other manufacturing, Retail, Hotels, Other Services
2. Region: 7 categories: Dhaka MA, Greater Dhaka, Chattogram, Cox’s Bazar, Rajshahi, Khulna, Sylhet, Barisal
3. Size: 3 categories: Small, Medium, Large
### The sample sizes for each stratum were determined using the size of the sample frame, aiming for a confidence interval of 90% and precision between 5% to 7.5%
▶ It can be said to have representativeness for each stratum

# The analyzable scope of the data 1) Industry
## Five industries(Garments, Textiles, Food, Hotel and Restaurants, Retail) surveyed in all two years with sufficient data counts were chosen as the subjects for analysis
- When there is a small number of data for a specific industry, there may be representativeness, but there is a possibility of a large margin of error in estimating the population
- From 2013 to 2022, the proportion of the Services industry increased, with higher proportions observed in the Hotel and Restaurant industry as well as the Retail industry
- In the manufacturing sector, the survey proportions for Garments, Textiles, and Food industries were high in 2013, and 2022
